It is a result of  the small intestine’s inability to produce enough of the enzyme  lactase, which is produced by the small intestine. Symptoms of  lactose intolerance usually affect the GI tract and can include  bloating, abdominal pain, gas, nausea, and diarrhea. An intolerance  is best managed by making dietary changes and avoiding any foods  that trigger the reaction.8  The Threat of Lead Toxicity  There is a danger of lead toxicity, or lead poisoning, among school- aged children. Lead is found in plumbing in old homes, in lead-based  paint, and occasionally in the soil. Contaminated food and water can  increase exposure and result in hazardous lead levels in the blood.  Children under age six are especially vulnerable. They may consume  items tainted with lead, such as chipped, lead-based paint. Another  common exposure is lead dust in carpets, with the dust flaking off  of paint on walls. When children play or roll around on carpets  coated with lead, they are in jeopardy. Lead is indestructible, and  once it has been ingested it is difficult for the human body to alter  or remove it. It can quietly build up in the body for months, or even  years, before the onset of symptoms. Lead toxicity can damage the  brain and central nervous system, resulting in impaired thinking,  reasoning, and perception.  8.\\xa0Lactose Intolerance.

How Much Protein Does a Person Need in Their  Diet?

Why then, does the water not flow from blood  plasma to cells? The force of water also known as hydrostatic  pressure  maintains  the  volumes  of  water  between  fluid  compartments against the force of all dissolved substances. The  concentration is the amount of particles in a set volume of water.  (Recall that individual solutes can differ in concentration between  the intracellular and extracellular fluids, but the total concentration  of all dissolved substances is equal.)  The force driving the water movement through the selectively  permeable membrane is the higher solute concentration on the  one side. Solutes at different concentrations on either side of a  selectively permeable membrane exert a force, called osmotic  pressure. The higher concentration of solutes on one side compared  to the other of the U-tube exerts osmotic pressure, pulling the  water to a higher volume on the side of the U-tube containing  more dissolved particles. When the osmotic pressure is equal to the  pressure of the water on the selectively permeable membrane, net  water movement stops (though it still diffuses back and forth at an  equal rate).  One equation exemplifying equal concentrations but different  volumes is the following  5 grams of glucose in 1 liter = 10 grams of glucose in 2 liters (5g/L =  5g/L)  The differences in concentrations of particular substances  provide concentration gradients that cells can use to perform work.  A concentration gradient is a form of potential energy, like water  172  |  Electrolytes Important for Fluid Balance\",\n          \"Units of Measure  UNIVERSITY OF HAWAI\\u2018I AT M\\u0100NOA FOOD SCIENCE AND HUMAN  NUTRITION PROGRAM AND HUMAN NUTRITION PROGRAM  In  nutrition,  there  are  two  systems  of  commonly  used  measurements: Metric and US Customary.

For example, dental problems can lead to difficulties  with chewing and swallowing, which in turn can make it hard to  maintain a healthy diet. The use of dentures or the preparation of  pureed or chopped foods can help solve this problem. There also  is a decreased thirst response in the elderly, and the kidneys have  a decreased ability to concentrate urine, both of which can lead to  dehydration.  Sensory Issues  At about age sixty, taste buds begin to decrease in size and number.  As a result, the taste threshold is higher in older adults, meaning  that more of the same flavor must be present to detect the taste.  Many elderly people lose the ability to distinguish between salty,  sour, sweet, and bitter flavors. This can make food seem less  appealing and decrease the appetite. An intake of foods high in  sugar and sodium can increase due to an inability to discern those  tastes. The sense of smell also decreases, which impacts attitudes  toward food. Sensory issues may also affect the digestion because  the taste and smell of food stimulates the secretion of  digestive\\u00a0enzymes in the mouth, stomach, and pancreas.  Dysphagia  Some older adults have difficulty getting adequate nutrition  because of the disorder dysphagia, which impairs the ability to  swallow. Any damage to the parts of the brain that control  swallowing can result in dysphagia, therefore stroke is a common  cause. Dysphagia is also associated with advanced dementia  because of overall brain function impairment. To assist older adults  suffering from dysphagia, it can be helpful to alter food consistency.

Shortly after birth, the expulsion of the  placenta triggers progesterone levels to fall, which activates  lactation.15 When the infant suckles at the breast, levels of the  hormone oxytocin rise to promote the release of breast milk from  the breast when the infant suckles, which is known as the milk- ejection reflex.  New mothers usually find that their appetite and thirst is greater  than before pregnancy; it is recommended that they still focus on  nutrient-dense foods to nourish their body and replace their body’s  nutrient stores. A conservative rate of weight loss (1-2 pounds per  week) during lactation does not usually impact the quantity or  quality of breast milk, but maternal deficiencies in some nutrients  have been described during lactation. The nutrient content of  breastmilk does not change much based upon maternal diet for  most nutrients. The RDA for energy is 330 additional Calories during  the first six months of lactation and 400 additional Calories during  the second six months of lactation. The energy needed to support  breastfeeding comes from both increased intake and from stored  fat. For example, during the first six months after her baby is born,  the daily caloric cost for a lactating mother is 500 Calories, with  330 calories derived from increased intake and 170 Calories derived  from maternal fat stores. This helps explain why breastfeeding may  promote weight loss in new mothers. Lactating women should also  drink 3.1 liters of liquids per day (about 13 cups) to avoid  dehydration, according to the IOM.',\n",
